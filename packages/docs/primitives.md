## Trees 

In MACI, we have different types of trees that hold different values:

| Tree Name | Description | Specifics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State Tree | Holds all signups | Participant public key and the timestamp at which they signed up (Applies to all Polls) |
| Ballot Tree | Holds the participants' votes | Poll specific |
| Message Tree | Holds participants' commands | Poll specific |
